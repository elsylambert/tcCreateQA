  My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
  He spaded it, removed the stones, and planted it with an excellent kind of vine.
  He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress.
  He waited for it to produce grapes, but it only produced wild grapes. (Isaiah 5:1-2)  
  For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. (Matthew 20:1 ULT)  
  There was a man, a landowner. He planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a watchtower, and rented it out to vine growers. Then he went into another country. (Matthew 21:33 ULT)
