I am a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus the Messiah. God sent me to teach the people whom he has chosen as his own to trust him more. I work to help his people to know what is true, so that they can live in a way that pleases God.1:2  ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου, ἣν ἐπηγγείλατο ὁ ἀψευδὴς Θεὸς πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων,1:2 with the certain hope of everlasting life that God, who does not lie, promised before all the ages of time.1:2 His people can learn how to live like this because they are confident that God will cause them to live forever. God does not lie. Even before the world began, he promised to cause us to live forever.1:3  ἐφανέρωσεν δὲ καιροῖς ἰδίοις τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ ἐν κηρύγματι, ὃ ἐπιστεύθην ἐγὼ, κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, Θεοῦ;1:3 But at the right time, he revealed his word by the proclamation that I was entrusted with by the command of God our Savior.
1:3 Then, at the right time, he communicated his plan through this message that he trusted me to preach. I do this in order to obey the command of God, who saves us.
1:4  Τίτῳ, γνησίῳ τέκνῳ, κατὰ κοινὴν πίστιν: χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς  καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν.
1:4 To Titus, a true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
1:4 I am writing to you, Titus; you have become like a real son to me because we both now believe in Jesus the Messiah. May God the Father and the Messiah Jesus who saves us continue to be kind to you and to give you a peaceful spirit.
